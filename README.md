# Welcome to the Realm of the Bandgeek 🎼.

My name is Robin and I am a full-stack web developer residing in Kentucky.

### About Me 🙋‍♂️

Hey there! I'm a Marine Corps vet 🎖️, a music lover 🎵, Otaku ⚔️, cosplay enthusiast, and basketball junkie 🏀. Born in Jacksonville, FL, but raised all over the place as a military brat.

I once tried the whole psychology degree thing, but life happened, and I quickly realized it wasn't my gig. Now, I'm back in action, reinventing myself as a developer and soaking up knowledge like a sponge.

Life's thrown some curveballs, but I've got this killer resilience that keeps me pushing forward. I truly believe the sky's the limit, no matter what comes my way. Every stumble in life is just another chance to get stronger and smarter—like those sore muscles after a good workout or turning life's lemons into some kind of awesome lemonade.

So, stick around, watch me pick up new skills, see me evolve, and let's get to know each other a bit better!
